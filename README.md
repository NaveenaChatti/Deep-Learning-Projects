FFNN (Feedforward Neural Network): Developed a Feedforward Neural Network to explore fundamental neural network architectures and their ability to learn patterns from structured data.
Autoencoders: Built autoencoders to reduce data dimensionality and extract useful features for applications like anomaly detection.
Dropout Regularization: Implemented dropout in neural networks to improve generalization by preventing overfitting and enhancing model robustness.
NANO GPT Training on Spotify Dataset: Trained a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model on Spotify's music data to generate personalized music recommendations and insights.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Applied CNNs to analyze image datasets such as MSNIT and CIFAR, showcasing their power in classifying and recognizing visual patterns.
This concise overview highlights each of my deep learning projects and their purpose.
