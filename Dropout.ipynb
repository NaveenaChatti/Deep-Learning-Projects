        "Classical generalization theory\n",

        "train and test performance,\n",
        "we should aim for a simple model.\n",
        "Simplicity can come in the form\n",

        "We explored this when discussing the\n",
        "monomial basis functions of linear models.\n",
        "Additionally, as we saw when discussing weight decay\n",
        "($\\ell_2$ regularization),\n",
        "the (inverse) norm of the parameters also\n",
        "represents a useful measure of simplicity.\n",
        "Another useful notion of simplicity is smoothness,\n",
        "i.e., that the function should not be sensitive\n",
        "to small changes to its inputs.\n",
        "For instance, when we classify images,\n",
        "we would expect that adding some random noise\n",
        "to the pixels should be mostly harmless.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scientists formalized\n",
        "this idea when he proved that training with input noise\n",
        "is equivalent to Tikhonov regularization.\n",
        "This work drew a clear mathematical connection\n",
        "between the requirement that a function be smooth (and thus simple),\n",
        "and the requirement that it be resilient\n",
        "to perturbations in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, :citet:`Srivastava.Hinton.Krizhevsky.ea.2014`\n",
        "developed a clever idea for how to apply Bishop's idea\n",
        "to the internal layers of a network, too.\n",
        "Their idea, called *dropout*, involves\n",
        "injecting noise while computing\n",
        "each internal layer during forward propagation,\n",
        "and it has become a standard technique\n",
        "for training neural networks.\n",
        "The method is called *dropout* because we literally\n",
        "*drop out* some neurons during training.\n",
        "Throughout training, on each iteration,\n",
        "standard dropout consists of zeroing out\n",

        "offers intuition through a surprising\n",
        "analogy to sexual reproduction.\n",
        "The authors argue that neural network overfitting\n",
        "is characterized by a state in which\n",
        "each layer relies on a specific\n",
        "pattern of activations in the previous layer,\n",
        "calling this condition *co-adaptation*.\n",

        "While such an justification of this theory is certainly up for debate,\n",
        "the dropout technique itself has proved enduring,\n",

        "in most deep learning libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The key challenge is how to inject this noise.\n",
        "One idea is to inject it in an *unbiased* manner\n",
        "so that the expected value of each layer---while fixing\n",
        "the others---equals the value it would have taken absent noise.\n",
        "In Bishop's work, he added Gaussian noise\n",
        "to the inputs to a linear model.\n",
        "At each training iteration, he added noise\n",

In contrast, the model without dropout achieved a training accuracy of 90.64% and a test accuracy of 88.89%, suggesting good generalization but also potential overfitting since the training accuracy continued to rise while test accuracy stabilized.\n",

Therefore, it’s generally not recommended to use dropout in the testing phase, as it can diminish the model's predictive power and lead to misleading results.\n",
